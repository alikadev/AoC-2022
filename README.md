# Advent of Code 2022

## The Advent of Code Event in C

I'm actually participating to the `AoC 2022` in `C` (`C99`)! This is the first time that I participate to a *coding event*

**Please** try it yourself before spoile yourself with other developper code!

This code isn't well, I just want to participate to this event! 

I'll maybe start learning an other language during this event. (like `Fortran` or `Pascal`)

Sorry for my bad english, I'm just an 18 year old swiss child...

### Overall structure

The `default` directory is the base project I use for the event, it may be updated during the event.

The `day_xx` directories are the independant project.

### Program structure

All the programs are compiled with a `Makefile` with `gcc`.

The directories are:

- `src` contains the sources.
- `build` contains the compiled object file.
- `release` contains a copy of the first and second part

You need to add the `data.in` file for the project to run.

### How to build and run the programs

You can build the application with the `Makefile`. You can write `make help` to get the list of all the commands.

You need to add the `data.in` file for the project to run.

The program will create a `data.out` file with the output.
